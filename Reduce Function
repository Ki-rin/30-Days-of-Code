'''
The reduce() function accepts a function and a sequence and returns a single value calculated as follows:
- Initially, the function is called with the first two items from the sequence and the result is returned.
- The function is then called again with the result obtained in step 1 and the next value in the sequence. 
- This process keeps repeating until there are items in the sequence.
