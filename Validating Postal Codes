'''
regex_alternating_repetitive_digit_pair checks that 
it not contains more than one alternating repetitive digit pair
Alternating repetitive digits are digits which repeat immediately after the next digit. In other words, an alternating repetitive digit pair is formed by two equal digits that have just a single digit between them.

'''
() groups sub-patterns
? matches zero or one occurrence of the pattern left to it.

(?=...)
Matches if ... matches next, but doesn’t consume any of the string. This is called a lookahead assertion. For example, Isaac (?=Asimov) will match 'Isaac ' only if it’s followed by 'Asimov'.

. a period matches any single character (except newline '\n').

\number
Matches the contents of the group of the same number. Groups are numbered starting from 1. For example, (.+) \1 matches 'the the' or '55 55', but not 'thethe'
